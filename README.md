## Farm Production Optimization

A farmer has 100 acres of land to grow wheat (W) and corn (C). The goal is to maximize profit while considering land, labor, and water constraints.

# Data:
Wheat:

Profit: $200 per acre

Labor: 3 hours per acre

Water: 4 units per acre

Corn:

Profit: $300 per acre

Labor: 2 hours per acre

Water: 6 units per acre

# Constraints:
Land: Maximum 100 acres

Labor: Maximum 240 hours

Water: Maximum 400 units

# Objective Function
Maximize profit:
Z = 200W + 300C
